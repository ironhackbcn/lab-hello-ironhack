# React | React Landing Page

## Introduction

We just learned the basics about creating an app in React with create-react-app, so we will use this exercise to re-do what we just learned (and hopefully to add some style :blossom: ).

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.


## Instructions

### Iteration 1 - Create the App

Let's start with the basics: as you can see `public` folder is already there and it has some images in it. We will have to move these images to the `public` folder from create-react-app. Also, remember that the `index.html` file is where you will have the entry point of the application.


#### Babel and Webpack

Our project needs to have two important packages that are necessary for compiling: `Babel` and `Webpack`.

But don't worry, create-react-app will take care of it.


### Iteration 2 - React Creation

  ```
  npx creacte-react-app my-first-react-app
  cd to my-first-react-app
  npm start
  ```

## Iteration 3 - First Landing Page

Finally, let's create our landing page. In the `public` folder, you will find all the assets you need to recreate the following landing page:

For now, don't worry about creating more than one component, we will cover that in the following lessons!

Happy coding! :heart:
